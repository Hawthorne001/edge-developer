<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS carousel widget: `::column` pseudo-element

The `::column` CSS pseudo-element represents the individual columns in a multi-column container, which can be styled with a limited amount of CSS properties and can be snapped to by its scrolling container, using `::scroll-marker` pseudo-elements.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS carousel widget: `::scroll-marker` and `::scroll-marker-groups` pseudo-elements

The `::scroll-marker` and `::scroll-markers-group` pseudo-elements allow to create a set of focusable markers within a scroll container, used to snap the scroll container to specific positions.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS carousel widget: `::scroll-button()` pseudo-element

The `::scroll-button()` pseudo-element allows to create scroll buttons as pseudo-elements of a scroll containers. The scroll buttons are used to scroll the container in the direction of the button when activated.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Nested pseudo-elements styling

Pseudo-elements that are nested inside other pseudo-elements can now be styled. So far, `::before::marker` and `::after::marker` are supported. Support for `::column::scroll-marker` will be added in the future.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `interactivity` property

The CSS `interactivity` property specifies whether an element and its flat tree descendants (including text runs) are inert or not. Making an element inert affects whether it can be focused, edited, selected, and searchable by find-in-page. It also affects whether it is visible in the accessibility tree.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS logical overflow properties

The `overflow-inline` and `overflow-block` CSS properties allow setting overflow in inline and block direction relative to the writing-mode. In a horizontal writing-mode `overflow-inline` maps to `overflow-x`, while in a vertical writing-mode it maps to `overflow-y`.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `abs()` and `sign()` functions

The `abs(A)` function returns the absolute value of A, as the same type as the input. The `sign(A)` function returns `-1` if A's numeric value is negative, `+1` if A's numeric value is positive, `0` otherwise. The return type is a `<number>`.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS anchor positioning: remembered scroll offset

When a positioned element has a default anchor, and is tethered to this anchor at one edge, and against the original containing block at the other edge, the scroll offset will be taken into account when it comes to sizing the element. This way a developer can use all visible space (using `position-area`) for the anchored element when the document is scrolled at a given scroll offset.

In order to avoid resizing the element every time the document is scrolled, the "remembered scroll offset" concept is used, rather than always using the current scroll offset.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `dynamic-range-limit` property

The `dynamic-range-limit` CSS property allows to limit the maximum brightness of HDR content.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `shape()` function

The `shape()` CSS function allows using free-form and responsive shapes in the `clip-path` property.

You can define a series of verbs, equivalent to the verbs in the `path()` function, and use responsive units, such as `%` or `vw`, as well as any CSS values such as custom properties.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `progress()` functions

The `progress()`, `media-progress()`, and `container-progress()` functions represent the proportional distance of a given value (the progress value) from one value (the progress start value) to another value (the progress end value). They allow drawing a progress ratio from math functions, media features, and container features, respectively.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `safe-area-max-inset-*` variables

The `safe-area-max-inset-top`, `safe-area-max-inset-right`, `safe-area-max-inset-bottom`, and `safe-area-max-inset-left` environment variables are tied to the safe area inset variables, but represent the maximum possible safe area, which is useful to avoid updating the layout of a page when the safe area inset value grows.


<!-- ---------- -->
#### HTML features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `command` and `commandfor` HTML attributes

The `command` and `commandfor` HTML attributes for `<button>` elements allow you to assign behaviour to buttons in an accessible and declarative way, while reducing the amount of JavaScript pages are required to ship for interactivity. Whe clicked, touched, or activated via keypress, a button with the `commandfor` and `command` attributes dispatches a `CommandEvent` on the element referenced by `commandfor`, with some default behaviours such as opening dialogs and popovers.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Link `rel=facilitated-payment` to support push payments

The `<link rel="facilitated-payment" href="...">` element acts as a hint that the browser uses to notify registered payment clients about a pending push payment.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support for `rel` and `relList` attributes in SVG `<a>` elements

The SVGAElement interface in SVG 2.0 allows manipulating SVG `<a>` elements similar to HTML anchor elements. This change adds support for the `rel` and `relList` attributes to enhance security and privacy for developers. This aligns with how HTML anchor elements work, and ensures consistency and ease of use across SVG and HMTL.


<!-- ---------- -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Add MediaStreamTrack support to the Web Speech API

The Web Speech API is a web standard API that allows developers to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their web pages. Currently, the Web Speech API uses the user's default microphone as the audio input. MediaStreamTrack support allows websites to use the Web Speech API to caption other sources of audio including remote audio tracks.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/Navigation

Blob URL access is now partitioned by storage key. Storage keys are top-level sites, frame origins, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean. Top-level navigations remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what's currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning.

In addition, Edge now enforce noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns with similar behavior in Safari and with the corresponding specifications.

This change can be temporarily reverted by setting the `PartitionedBlobUrlUsage` policy. If this policy is set to `Enabled` or not set, Blob URLs are partitioned. If this policy is set to `Disabled`, Blob URLs are not partitioned.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Partitioning `:visited` links history

To eliminate user browsing history leaks, HTML `<a>` elements are now styled as `:visited` only if they have been clicked from the top-level site and frame origin before. This means that Microsoft Edge now partitions visited links according to three keys: link URL, top-level site, frame origin. By only styling links that have been clicked on this site and frame before, side-channel attacks that have been developed to obtain `:visited` links styling information are now obsolete.

_Self-links_ are excluded from this: links to a site's own pages can be styled as `:visited` even if they have not been clicked on in this exact top-level site and frame origin before. This exemption is only enabled in top-level frames or subframes which are same-origin with the top-level frame.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Incorporate navigation initiator into the HTTP cache partition key

The browser's HTTP cache keying scheme now includes an `is-cross-site-main-frame-navigation` boolean to mitigate cross-site leak attacks involving top-level navigation. This prevents cross-site attacks in which an attacker can initiate a top-level navigation to a given page and then navigate to a resource known to be loaded by the page in order to infer sensitive information via load timing. This change also improves privacy by preventing a malicious site from using navigations to infer whether a user has visited a given site previously.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSP `require-sri-for` for scripts

The `require-sri-for` directive, and its `script` value, give developers the ability to assert that every resource of a given type needs to be checked for integrity. If a resource of that type is attempted to be loaded without integrity metadata, that attempt will fail and trigger a CSP violation report.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Create service worker client and inherit service worker controller for iframe with `srcdoc`

Documents created by iframes that use the `srcdoc` attribute are now service worker clients that are covered by their parent's service worker.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Dispatching click events to captured pointer

If a pointer is captured while the `pointerup` event is being dispatched, the `click` event is dispatched to the captured target instead of the nearest common ancestor of `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Float16Array

This adds support for the Float16Array typed array. Number values are rounded to half-precision float-point format (IEEE FP16) when writing into Float16Array instances.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### HSTS tracking prevention

Mitigates user tracking by third-parties via the HSTS cache.

This feature only allows HSTS upgrades for top-level navigations and blocks HSTS upgrades for sub-resource requests. Doing so makes it infeasible for third-party sites to use the HSTS cache in order to track users across the web.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `sourceElement` property for `NavigateEvent`

When a page navigation is initiated by an element, for example when the user clicks a link or submits a form, the resulting `NavigateEvent` now has a `sourceElement` property which points to the initiating element.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### PerformanceNavigationTiming API NotRestoredReasons name change

The NotRestoredReasons API is part of the PerformanceNavigationTiming API. This change updates the names of the reasons so that they match the specification.

List of changes:

| Old name | New name |
| --- | --- |
| `extension-messaging`, `pending-permission-request`, `not-main-frame`, `frame-navigating`, `timeout`, `cookie-disabled`, `cookie-removed`, `printing`, `web-database`, `injected-javascript`, and `injected-stylesheet` | `masked` |
| `response-method-not-get` | `request-method-not-get` |
| `serviceworker-version-activation` | `serviceworker-version-activated` |
| `serviceworker-added-after-bfcache` | `serviceworker-added` |
| `serviceworker-unregistration` | `serviceworker-unregistered` |
| `unload-handler` | `unload-listener` |
| `session-restored` | `null` |


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Observable API

Observables are a popular reactive-programming paradigm to handle an asynchronous stream of push-based events. They can be thought of as Promises but for multiple events, and aim to do what Promises did for callbacks/nesting. That is, they allow ergonomic event handling by providing an Observable object that represents the asynchronous flow of events.

You can "subscribe" to this object to receive events as they come in, and call any of its operators/combinators to declaratively describe the flow of transformations through which events go. This is in contrast with the imperative version, which often requires complicated nesting with things like `addEventListener()`. For more on this, see the examples in the explainer.

See the [W3C Observable specification](https://wicg.github.io/observable/).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Service worker client URL now ignores `history.pushState` changes

The `Client.url` property of a service worker now ignores document URL changes made by the `history.pushState()` method and other similar history APIs. The `Client.url` property is intended to be the creation URL of the HTML document which ignores such changes.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Timestamps for RTC Encoded Frames

Expose the following timestamps that are present in WebRTC encoded frames transmitted via `RTCPeerConnection`:

* Capture timestamp: the timestamp when a frame was originally captured.
* Receive timestamp: the timestamp when a frame was received.

This change allows video conferencing applications which use WebRTC to implement latency measurements to better understand performance.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Use the `double` type for ProgressEvent's `loaded` and `total` attributes

The `loaded` and `total` attributes of a ProgressEvent indicate the current progress. The type of these attributes is now `double`, which gives developers more control over the value. For example, developers can now create a ProgressEvent with the value of `total` set to `1` and the the value of `loaded` increasing from `0` to `1` gradually. This aligns the event with the default behavior of the `<progress>` HTML element if the `max` attribute is omitted.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### fetchLater API

`fetchLater()` is a JavaScript API to send a deferred fetch request. Once sent, a deferred request is queued by the browser in a _pending_ state, and will be invoked by the earliest of the following conditions:

* The document is destroyed.
* After a user-specified time.
* When the browser decides it's time to send the request.

The API returns a `FetchLaterResult` that contains the `activated` boolean field, which may be updated to tell whether the deferred request has been sent or not. On successful sending, the response is ignored by browser, including its body and headers.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### highlightsFromPoint API

The `highlightsFromPoint()` API enables developers to interact with CSS Custom Highlights by detecting which highlights exist at a specific point within a document. Getting highlights from a point can be used by web apps to manage user interactions with custom highlights, such as responding to user clicks or hover events on highlighted regions to trigger custom tooltips or contextual menus.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated and removed features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Deprecate `Intl.Locale` getters

The `Intl.Locale` API exposes information such as week data and hour cycle type of a locale. The accessor properties of the `Intl.Locale` object are now deprecated, in favor of the corresponding functions, per specification. For example, the `Intl.Locale.prototype.hourCycle` accessor property is deprecated in favor of the `Intl.Locale.prototype.getHourCycles()` function.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove `navigator.xr.supportsSession` method

The `navigator.xr.supportsSession` property was replaced in the WebXR specification by the `navigator.xr.()` method in 2019. The `supportsSession` has been marked as deprecated since then. This change removes the deprecated `navigator.xr.supportsSession` property from the WebXR API.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove WebGPU limit `maxInterStageShaderComponents`

The `maxInterStageShaderComponents` limit is now removed due to the following reasons:

* Redundancy with `maxInterStageShaderVariables`, which already serves a similar purpose, controlling the amount of data passed between shader stages.
* Minor Discrepancies: while there are slight differences in how the two limits are calculated, these differences are minor and can be effectively managed within the `maxInterStageShaderVariables` limit.
* Simplification: removing `maxInterStageShaderComponents` streamlines the shader interface and reduces complexity for developers. Instead of managing two separate limits (that both apply simultaneously but with subtle differences), they can focus on the more appropriately named and comprehensive `maxInterStageShaderVariables`.
