-->


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Auto-generated view transition names

The `view-transition-name` CSS property supports two new values, which help reduce the burden of having to invent unique names for elements that participate in a view transition. These values are:

* `match-element`, which generates a unique ID that's based on the element's identity. This value is useful in single page applications where the element that's animated with a view transition is being moved in the DOM.

* `auto`, which generates a unique ID that's based on the element's `id` attribute. This value only takes the `id` attribute into account and ignores the type of element, which can be useful for view transitions to work across multiple pages of an application, where elements with the same `id` attribute may be different.

See [Determining view-transition-name automatically](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#auto-vt-name).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `stretch` sizing keyword

Various sizing properties in CSS, such as `width` or `height`, now accept the `stretch` keyword.

`stretch` allows elements to grow to exactly fill their containing block's available space. It is similar to using the `100%` value, however the resulting size is applied to the element's margin box instead of the box indicated by the `box-sizing` property.

Using this keyword allows the element to keep its margins while still being as large as possible.

See [stretch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/width#stretch), in _width_, at MDN


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `dynamic-range-limit` property

The `dynamic-range-limit` CSS property allows limiting the maximum brightness of High Dynamic Range (HDR) content.

See [Controlling Dynamic Range](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-hdr/#controlling-dynamic-range), in _CSS Color HDR Module Level 1_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Ignore `letter-spacing` in cursive scripts

Per specification, the browser now ignores the `letter-spacing` CSS property when rendering cursive scripts, to avoid breaking words.

If possible, the browser may apply letter spacing by translating the extra space into cursive elongation or compression. If the text cannot be expanded without breaking cursive connections, the browser treats each word as a single typographic unit for letter spacing.

Proper cursive elongation or compression varies based on script, typeface, language, word location, line location, implementation complexity, font capabilities, and calligraphic preferences. It may involve shortening ligatures, swash variants, contextual forms, or elongation glyphs.

Web developers should avoid applying the  `letter-spacing` property to cursive scripts unless they are prepared to accept non-interoperable results.

See [letter-spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Change the `string` CSS type in the `attr()` function to `raw-string`

When using a `string` type in the `attr()` CSS function, use the `raw-string` type instead.

For example, `attr(data-foo string)` is now `attr(data-foo raw-string)`.

See [attr()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/attr) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Type-agnostic `var()` fallback

The `var()` CSS function accepts a fallback value as its second argument, in case the referenced custom property does not exist or is invalid: `width: var(--undefined-width, 100px)`.

Previously, when the referenced custom property was registered with a specific type, by using the `@property` rule, the fallback value of a `var()` function only applied if it was of the same type as the referenced custom property.

This change allows the fallback value to be of any type, regardless of the type of the referenced custom property.

See [var()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/var) and [@property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@property) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Unprefixed `print-color-adjust`

The `print-color-adjust` CSS property now works without the `-webkit-` prefix.

The `print-color-adjust` property allows adjusting colors in printed web pages.

See [print-color-adjust](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/print-color-adjust) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Fluent scrollbars.

Overlay and non-overlay scrollbars now match the Fluent design language on Windows and Linux.

See [Fluent Scrollbars Visual Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haDpb1QIh2PaLwsQD1i4WHFq_5_jSK3XK9lhgSs4WkM/edit).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### AudioContext `interrupted` state

Currently, the Web Audio API doesn't have a mechanism for the browser to interrupt playback for scenarios such as exclusive audio access (VoIP) or when a laptop lid is closed. This change introduces the `interrupted` state to the `AudioContextState` interface. This new state allows the browser to pause playback in the above scenarios and enables web applications to respond appropriately.

See [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/Navigation

Blob URL access is now partitioned by storage key. Storage keys are top-level sites, frame origins, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean. Top-level navigations remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what's currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning.

In addition, Edge now enforce noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns with similar behavior in Safari and with the corresponding specifications.

This change can be temporarily reverted by setting the `PartitionedBlobUrlUsage` policy. If this policy is set to `Enabled` or not set, Blob URLs are partitioned. If this policy is set to `Disabled`, Blob URLs are not partitioned.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Partitioning `:visited` links history

To eliminate user browsing history leaks, HTML `<a>` elements are now styled as `:visited` only if they have been clicked from the top-level site and frame origin before.  This means that Microsoft Edge now partitions visited links according to three keys:
* Link URL.
* Top-level site.
* Frame origin.

By only styling links that have been clicked on this site and frame before, side-channel attacks that have been developed to obtain `:visited` links styling information are now obsolete.

_Self-links_ are excluded from this; links to a site's own pages can be styled as `:visited` even if they have not been clicked on in this exact top-level site and frame origin before.  This exemption is only enabled in top-level frames or subframes which are same-origin with the top-level frame.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Navigation initiator used in the HTTP cache partition key

The browser's HTTP cache keying scheme now includes the boolean `is-cross-site-main-frame-navigation` to mitigate cross-site leak attacks involving top-level navigation.

This prevents cross-site attacks in which an attacker can initiate a top-level navigation to a given page and then navigate to a resource known to be loaded by the page in order to infer sensitive information via load timing.

This change also improves privacy by preventing a malicious site from using navigations to infer whether a user has visited a given site previously.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSP `require-sri-for` for scripts

The `require-sri-for` directive gives developers the ability to assert that every resource of a given type needs to be checked for integrity.

If a resource of that type is attempted to be loaded without integrity metadata, that attempt fails and trigger a CSP violation report.

See [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Call stacks in crash reports from unresponsive web pages

When a web page becomes unresponsive due to JavaScript code running an infinite loop or other very long computation, the Javascript call stack is recorded and included in the crash report that's sent to the Reporting API server endpoint configured by the website.

See [Reporting API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Captured surface control

The `CaptureController` API allows video-conferencing applications to control the zoom level and scroll position of the content of a browser tab that's being screenshared.

See the [Captured Surface Control](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-surface-control/) specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Captured surface resolution

The `screenPixelRatio` property of the `MediaStreamTrack` API exposes the pixel ratio of the captured surface while screensharing.

This property allows applications to preserve system resources or adapt to the quality/bandwidth trade-off according to the physical and logical resolutions of the captured surface.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Dispatching click events to captured pointer

If a pointer is captured while the `pointerup` event is being dispatched, the `click` event is dispatched to the captured target instead of the nearest common ancestor of `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events.

The `click` target remains unchanged for uncaptured pointers.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Explicit compile hints with magic comments

Magic comments signal the browser that the functions in a JavaScript file are likely to be needed by the website. This allows the browser to parse, compile and/or cache them eagerly, which can improve page load times.

In JavaScript, magic comments are comments that start with `//#`.

See [Explainer for Explicit JavaScript Compile Hints](https://github.com/WICG/explicit-javascript-compile-hints-file-based/blob/main/README.md).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### H265 (HEVC) codec support in WebRTC

The H265 (HEVC) codec has increased compression efficiency (higher quality per bitrate) relative to VP8/VP9/H264 and very strong hardware support. Support for the H265 (HEVC) codec in WebRTC improves the visual experience, increases battery life, and reduces the risk of performance issues.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### H26x codec support updates for MediaRecorder

The MediaRecorder API now supports HEVC encoding. This introduces the hvc1.* codec string, and adds new codecs (hev1.* and avc3.*), which support variable resolution video in MP4.

The MediaRecorder API now supports both MP4 and Matroska muxer types with different HEVC and H.264 mime type specifications. HEVC encoding is only supported if the user's device and operating system provide the necessary capabilities.

See [MediaRecorder](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Language support for `CanvasTextDrawingStyles`

The `lang` attribute can now be set on a `<canvas>` or `OffscreenCanvas` context. This allows developers to specify the language for text drawing and metrics in canvas, which is important for correct rendering of text in different languages, especially when rendering or measuring text content offscreen before outputting it to a visible canvas.

See [OffscreenCanvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Permissions Policy reports for iframes

Permissions Policy violation reports for cross-origin iframes are only sent to the iframe's reporting endpoint and not to the embedder's reporting endpoint, because of the concern that it might leak sensitive information about a cross-origin iframe. However, this makes it difficult for sites to enforce Permissions Policy because it can't learn about breakages in cross-origin iframes.

The new violation called _Potential Permissions Policy violation_ analyzes:

* The existing Permissions Policy (including `report-only` policy).
* The `allow` attribute set in iframes.

Based on the above, the violation detects the conflict between the enforced Permissions Policy and the permissions being propagated to iframes.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Predictable reported storage quota

The StorageManager's `estimate`  now reports a predictable storage quota for sites that have limited storage permissions.

This prevents the detection of a user's browsing mode via the storage API by reporting an artificial quota, equal to the current usage + 10 Gib, in all browsing modes.

Sites with unlimited storage permissions and enforced quotas are unaffected.

See [Storage quotas and eviction criteria](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage_API/Storage_quotas_and_eviction_criteria) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Aggregate error reporting with the Private Aggregation API

Developers can register histogram contributions that should only be sent if a particular type of error occurs when using the Private Aggregation API.

There are a range of error conditions that can be hit when using the Private Aggregation API. For example, the privacy budget could run out, preventing any further histogram contributions. 

This feature supports measuring the frequency of the error conditions and splitting these measurements on relevant developer-specified dimensions, for example by version of the website.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Strict Same Origin Policy for Storage Access API

The Storage Access API now follows the Same Origin Policy.

Using `document.requestStorageAccess()` in a frame only attaches cookies to the requests that are made to the iframe's origin by default.

The `CookiesAllowedForUrls` policy and Storage Access Headers can still be used to unblock cross-site cookies.

See [Storage Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Use the `double` type for ProgressEvent's `loaded` and `total` attributes

The `loaded` and `total` attributes of a `ProgressEvent` indicate the current progress.  The type of these attributes is now a floating point number between `0` and `1`, which aligns `ProgressEvent` with the default behavior of the `<progress>` HTML element, when the `max` attribute is omitted.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Use DOMPointInit for getCharNumAtPosition, isPointInFill, isPointInStroke

To match the SVGGeometryElement and SVGPathElement specifications, the `getCharNumAtPosition`, `isPointInFill`, and `isPointInStroke` methods now use `DOMPointInit` objects instead of an `SVGPoint` objects.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web Authentication Conditional Create

WebAuthn Conditional Create requests let a website create a passkey without prominent modal mediation, if the user has previously consented to credential creation.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Return multiple identity providers in single FedCM `get()` call

The Federated Credential Management API (FedCM) can now show multiple identity providers in the same dialog.

The `get()` method now returns all providers in a single call, which allows websites to present all supported identity providers to users.

See [Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated and removed features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Deprecate the `AutomaticHttpsDefault` policy

The `AutomaticHttpsDefault` is deprecated in Microsoft Edge version 136 and is planned to be removed in Microsoft Edge version 139. The new `HttpsUpgradesEnabled` policy should be used instead, and is available in Microsoft Edge version 136.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Deprecate `Intl.Locale` getters

The `Intl.Locale` API exposes information such as week data and hour cycle type of a locale.

The accessor properties of the `Intl.Locale` object are now deprecated, in favor of the corresponding functions, per the specification.  For example, the `Intl.Locale.prototype.hourCycle` accessor property is deprecated in favor of the `Intl.Locale.prototype.getHourCycles()` function.

See [Intl.Locale](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale) at MDN.
