## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Enabled features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### AudioContext Interrupted State

The current Web Audio API lacks a mechanism for the User Agent (UA) to interrupt playback for scenarios such as exclusive audio access (VoIP) or when a laptop lid is closed. To address this, we propose adding an "interrupted" state to AudioContextState. This new state would allow the UA to pause playback in these scenarios and enable web applications to respond appropriately. 


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Auto-generated view transition names

This intent covers two new keywords for view-transition-name:
- 'match-element' generates a unique id based on the element's identity and renames the same for this element. This is used in Single Page App cases where the element is being moved around and the desire is to animate it with a view transition

- 'auto' generates a unique id based on the element's id attribute. This value remains the same for the same ids regardless of the element, but does not otherwise match the view-transition-name named with the same ident as the id. This can be used in both Single and Multi Page Apps to match elements based on their id attributes.

Allow the 'auto' keyword as a value for the 'view-transition-name' CSS property. This generates a unique name for the element, and reduces the burden of having to invent unique names for participating elements.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/Navigation

As a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chromium will implement partitioning of Blob URL access by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean), with the exception of top-level navigations which will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what’s currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chromium will enforce noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chromium with similar behavior in Safari, and the relevant specs have been updated to reflect these changes. 

This change can be temporarily reverted by setting the PartitionedBlobURLUsage policy. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning related enterprise policies are deprecated.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSP require-sri-for for scripts

The `require-sri-for` directive gives developers the ability to assert that every resource of a given type needs to be integrity checked. If a resource of that type is attempted to be loaded without integrity metadata, that attempt will fail and trigger a CSP violation report.
This intent covers the "script" value of this directive.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS &#39;stretch&#39; sizing keyword

A keyword for CSS sizing properties (e.g. 'width', 'height') that allows elements to grow to exactly fill their containing block's available space. It is similar to '100%', except the resulting size is applied to the element's margin box instead of the box indicated by 'box-sizing'. Using this keyword allows the element to keep its margins while still being as large as possible. An unprefixed version of '-webkit-fill-available'.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS dynamic-range-limit property

Enables a page to limit the maximum brightness of HDR content.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS if() function

The CSS if() function provides a concise way to express conditional values. It accepts a series of condition-value pairs, delimited by semicolons. The function evaluates each condition sequentially and returns the value associated with the first true condition. If none of the conditions evaluate to true, the function returns an empty token stream. This allows web authors to express complex conditional logic in a simple and concise way.

Example:

<style>
  div {
      color: var(--color);
      background-color: if(style(--color: white): black; else: white);
  }
  .dark {
      --color: black;
  }
  .light {
      --color: white;
  }
</style>
<div class="dark">dark</div>
<div class="light">light</div>


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Call stacks in crash reports from unresponsive web pages

This feature captures the JS call stack when a web page becomes unresponsive due to JavaScript code running an infinite loop or other very long computation. This helps developers to identify the cause of the unresponsiveness and fix it more easily. The JS call stack is included in the crash reporting API when the reason is unresponsive.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Captured Surface Control

A Web API that allows Web applications to:
1. Forward wheel events to a captured tab.
2. Read and change the zoom level of a captured tab.



<!-- ---------- -->
###### CapturedSurfaceResolution

Expose pixel ratio of the captured surface while screensharing.

This feature will help applications to conserve their system resources or adapt the quality/bandwidth trade-off according to the physical and logical resolutions of the captured surface.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Controlled Frame API (available only to IWAs)

Adds a Controlled Frame API available only to Isolated Web Apps (IWAs).

This work adds a new Controlled Frame API which is only available to Isolated Web Apps (IWAs). Like similarly-named APIs on other platforms, Controlled Frame allows embedding all content, even third party content that can't be embedded in <iframe>. Controlled Frame also allows controlling embedded content with a collection of API methods and events.

For more info on Isolated Web Apps, see the IWA explainer: https://github.com/WICG/isolated-web-apps/blob/main/README.md


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Dispatching click events to captured pointer

If a pointer is captured while the `pointerup` event is being dispatched, the `click` event will be dispatched to the captured target instead of the nearest common ancestor of `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events as per the UI Event spec.

For uncaptured pointers, the `click` target  remains unchanged.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Explicit Compile Hints with Magic Comments

Allow attaching information about which functions should be eager parsed & compiled in JavaScript files.

The information will be encoded as magic comments.

We'll first target launching the file-based explicit compile hints, and as a follow up, investigate selecting individual functions for eager compilation.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### FedCM multi IDP in single get() call and remove add accounts in passive mode

Allows FedCM to show multiple identity providers in the same dialog. This provides developers with a convenient way to present all supported identity providers to users. We are planning to first tackle the simple case of having all providers in the same get() call.

We are also removing support for ‘add another account’ in FedCM passive mode. This feature allows showing a ‘use another account’ button alongside other IdP accounts in the chooser. The feature is currently unused, and UX conversations have led us to believe that supporting this leads to a more complicated flow without much benefit. This feature will still work in FedCM active mode.



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Fluent Scrollbars.

This feature modernizes the Chromium scrollbars (both overlay and non-overlay) on Windows and Linux to fit the Windows 11 Fluent design language.

Non-overlay Fluent scrollbars will be enabled by default in Linux and Windows. This change applies to Linux as well because Chromium's Linux scrollbar design has historically been aligned with what ships on Windows. How to expose enabling overlay Fluent scrollbars is still being decided.

Design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCmz2nbJV1XiopoLHnlrVaHCjhQMdiyDfPN_a22OIjU/edit?usp=sharing
Intent to implement: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/SomQdLx6aEk



<!-- ---------- -->
###### H265 (HEVC) codec support in WebRTC

This newer codec has increased compression efficiency (higher quality per bitrate) relative to VP8/VP9/H264 and very strong hardware support going back over a decade. This translates into improved visual experience, increased battery life and reduced risk of performance issues. The codec is already industry standard and we should support it in WebRTC when provided by the platform, i.e. if it is available in hardware (we will not provide a software implementation). This codec is already available in WebCodecs (M130) and MediaRecorder APIs (soon). Support will be queryable via MediaCapabilities API. Safari has already shipped support in WebRTC.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### H26x Codec support updates for MediaRecorder

Chromium's MediaRecorder API now supports HEVC encoding, introducing the hvc1.* codec string, and adds new codecs (hev1.* and avc3.*) supporting variable resolution video in MP4.

Support for HEVC platform encoding was added in WebCodecs in Chromium M130. As a follow-up, support has been added to the MediaRecorder API in Chromium. The API now supports both MP4 and Matroska muxer types with different HEVC and H.264 mime type specifications. HEVC encoding is only supported if the user's device and operating system provide the necessary capabilities.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### IP Address Logging &amp; Reporting

Chrome Enterprise is enhancing security monitoring and incident response capabilities by collecting and reporting local and remote IP addresses & sending those IP addresses to the Security Investigation Logs (SIT). In addition, Chrome Enterprise will allow admins to optionally send the IP addresses to 1P & 3P SIEM providers via the Chrome Enterprise Reporting connector.

This will be available for Chrome Enterprise Core customers. 

This will be available in M136.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Ignore Letter Spacing in Cursive Scripts

In this feature, adding logic to ignore the letter-spacing setting for cursive scripts, even if specified by the web author as per spec, to ensure that letter spacing does not break words.

To ensure letter spacing does not break words in cursive scripts, the UA should ignore the letter-spacing setting specified by the web author. If possible, the UA may apply letter spacing by translating the extra space into cursive elongation or compression. If the UA cannot expand text without breaking cursive connections, it must treat each word as a single typographic unit for letter-spacing.

Proper cursive elongation or compression varies based on script, typeface, language, word location, line location, implementation complexity, font capabilities, and calligraphic preferences. It may involve shortening ligatures, swash variants, contextual forms, or elongation glyphs such as U+0640 ـ ARABIC TATWEEL, or other microtypography. Authors should avoid applying letter-spacing to cursive scripts unless they are prepared to accept non-interoperable results.

Cursive scripts do not allow gaps between letters for justification or letter-spacing. Included Unicode scripts are Arabic, Hanifi Rohingya, Mandaic, Mongolian, N’Ko, Phags Pa, and Syriac.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Incorporating navigation initiator into the HTTP cache partition key

Chrome’s HTTP cache keying scheme will be updated to include an “is-cross-site-main-frame-navigation” boolean to mitigate cross-site leak attacks involving top-level navigation. Specifically, this will prevent cross-site attacks in which an attacker can initiate a top-level navigation to a given page and then navigate to a resource known to be loaded by the page in order to infer sensitive information via load timing. This change also improves privacy by preventing a malicious site from using navigations to infer whether a user has visited a given site previously.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Language support for CanvasTextDrawingStyles

The <canvas> DOM element, like all DOM elements, accepts a `lang` attribute that is used to define language specific treatment for font selection (when fonts have locale specific glyphs). Browsers respect this attribute. However, when an OffscreenCanvas is created there is no way to set locale information, possibly resulting in a state where an offscreen canvas produces rendered results that differ from the canvas in which it's output is used. This feature adds a `lang` IDL attribute to CanvasTextDrawingStyles to give developers direct control over the language for the text drawing and metrics.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Partitioning :visited links history

To eliminate user browsing history leaks, anchor elements are styled as :visited only if they have been clicked from this top-level site and frame origin before. On the browser-side, this means that the VisitedLinks hashtable is now partitioned via "triple-keying", or by storing the following for each visited link: <link URL, top-level site, frame origin>. By only styling links that have been clicked on this site and frame before, the many side-channel attacks that have been developed to obtain :visited links styling information are now obsolete, as they no longer provide sites with new information about users. 

There is an exception for "self-links", where links to a site's own pages can be styled as :visited even if they have not been clicked on in this exact top-level site and frame origin before. This exemption is only enabled in top-level frames or subframes which are same-origin with the top-level frame. The privacy benefits above are still achieved because sites already know which of its subpages a user has visited, so no new information is exposed. This was a community-requested exception which improves user experience as well.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Permissions Policy reports for iframes

Introduces a new violation type called "Potential Permissions Policy violation", which will only look at Permissions Policy (including report-only policy) and the allow attribute set in iframes to detect the conflict between Permissions Policy enforced vs permissions propagated to iframes.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Predictable reported storage quota

Report a predictable storage quota from StorageManager's estimate API for sites that do not have unlimited storage permissions.

It is possible to detect a user's browsing mode via the reported storage quota because the storage space made available is significantly smaller in incognito mode than in regular mode. This is a mitigation that prevents detection of a user's browsing mode via the storage API by reporting an artificial quota, equal to usage + 10 Gib, in all browsing modes for sites with limited storage permissions. Sites with unlimited storage permissions will be unaffected. Enforced quota will also be unaffected.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Private Aggregation API: Aggregate error reporting

There are a range of error conditions that can be hit when using the Private Aggregation API. For example, the privacy budget could run out, preventing any further histogram contributions. This feature allows developers to register histogram contributions that should only be sent if a particular type of error occurs.

This feature supports measuring the frequency of the error conditions and to split these measurements on relevant developer-specified dimensions (e.g. version of deployed code). As the errors themselves may be cross-site information, we cannot simply expose them to the page for users without third-party cookies. Instead, this feature reuses the existing aggregate, noised reporting pipelines through the Aggregation Service.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Rename `string` attr() type to `raw-string`

In  https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11645#issuecomment-2701601350 it was resolved to replace `string` attr() type with `raw-string`, see: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-5/#attr-notation.

Change attr() syntax, so that `attr(data-foo string)` will now become `attr(data-foo raw-string)`.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Strict Same Origin Policy for Storage Access API

Adjusts the Storage Access API semantics to strictly follow the Same Origin Policy, w.r.t. security. I.e., using document.requestStorageAccess() in a frame only attaches cookies to requests to the iframe's origin (not site) by default.

Note: the CookiesAllowedForUrls policy and/or Storage Access Headers may still be used to unblock cross-site cookies.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Type-agnostic var() fallback

The fallback part of a var() function does not validate against the type of the custom property being referenced.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Unprefixed print-color-adjust

The print-color-adjust allows adjusting colors in printed web pages.
This is the same as Chromium's already-supported -webkit-print-color-adjust, but with a standardized name.

The -webkit-prefixed version is not removed.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/print-color-adjust


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Update ProgressEvent to use double type for &#39;loaded&#39; and &#39;total&#39;

The ProgressEvent has attributes `loaded` and `total` indicating the progress, and their type is `unsigned long long` now.

With this feature, the type for these two attributes is changed to `double` instead, which gives the developer more control over the value. For example, the developers can now create a ProgressEvent with the `total` of 1 and the `loaded` increasing from 0 to 1 gradually. This is aligned with the default behavior of the <progress> HTML element if the max attribute is omitted. 


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Use DOMPointInit for getCharNumAtPosition, isPointInFill, isPointInStroke

This change brings Chromium code in line with the latest W3C spec
for SVGGeometryElement and SVGPathElement in terms of usage of
DOMPointInit over SVGPoint for getCharNumAtPosition, isPointInFill,
isPointInStroke.

The change has already landed: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6284886

Firefox and Safari already have this live making this a fairly safe change to land. Details for both added under Signals for both.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web Authentication Conditional Create (Passkey Upgrades)

WebAuthn Conditional Create requests let websites "upgrade" existing password credentials to a passkey.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated and removed features

**TODO: CHECK THE FEATURES LISTED BELOW AND ADD THEM TO THE SITE-COMPAT-IMPACTING-CHANGES ARTICLE.**



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Deprecate getters of Intl Locale Info

Intl Locale Info API is a Stage 3 ECMAScript TC39 proposal to enhance the Intl.Locale object by exposing Locale information, such as week data (first day in a week, weekend start day, weekend end day, minimun day in the first week), and text direction hour cycle used in the locale.
https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale-info

We ship our implementation in m99 (https://chromestatus.com/feature/5566859262820352 ) . But later on the propose made some change in Stage 3 and move several getters to functions. We need to remove the deprecated getters and relaunch the renamed functions



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove HTMLFencedFrameElement.canLoadOpaqueURL().

canLoadOpaqueURL() was replaced with navigator.canLoadAdAuctionFencedFrame() in 2023, and calling it has resulted in a deprecation console warning ever since pointing developers to the new API. It does not make sense to have the function attached to `HTMLFencedFrameElement` and instead should be attached to the `navigator` object (which contains other fenced frame + ad auction methods).
