# Curation and review process for the Microsoft Edge Add-ons site

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons team curates the [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/) site experience so that users can find all the items to customize their browser in one place, such as themes, extensions, and apps.

Available _items_ to customize the user's browser includes themes, extensions, and apps.

Before installing an item from the Microsoft Edge Add-ons site, users can learn more about the functionality, data permissions, and publisher by viewing the item's description and listing.

* The home page.
