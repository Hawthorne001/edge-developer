Native Client (NaCl) was a sandbox for running compiled C and C++ code in the browser efficiently and securely, independent of the user's operating system. \
As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance web security and performance, we are announcing the deprecation of NaCl for Microsoft Edge along with other browsers.   

We believe that the vibrant ecosystem around WebAssembly (Wasm)  makes it a better fit for new and existing high-performance web apps.
