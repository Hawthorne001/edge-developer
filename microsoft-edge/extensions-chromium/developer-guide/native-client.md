# Native Client (NaCl)

Native Client (NaCl) was a sandbox for running compiled C and C++ code in the browser efficiently and securely, independent of the user's operating system.

To enhance web security and performance, NaCl is deprecated for Microsoft Edge, along with other browsers.   

<!-- todo: hard or soft deprection?  ie, will it still work, but discouraged?  or won't work now?  dates? -->

The vibrant ecosystem around WebAssembly (Wasm) makes it a better fit for new and existing high-performance web apps.
